# UI-UX-Experiment5


## Aim:

To analyze two different UX project scenarios (a Health & Fitness App and an E-Commerce Handicraft Website) by identifying problem statements, choosing suitable research methods, and creating user personas to improve overall user experience.


## Algorithm:

Scenario 1: Health & Fitness Mobile Ap

1. Identify the target audience (health-conscious users, busy professionals).
2. Conduct **surveys** to understand user habits, goals, and fitness challenges.
3. Conduct **interviews** to capture emotional motivations and barriers.
4. Analyze collected data to extract key **pain points** and **user needs**.
5. Create detailed **user personas** representing the main user segments.
6. Design wireframes for tracking workouts, progress, and reminders.
7. Conduct **usability testing** to identify issues in navigation and motivation.
8. Refine the interface and features based on user feedback.


Scenario 2: E-Commerce Website for Local Handicrafts

1. Identify two user groups — **artisans** and **buyers**.
2. Conduct **interviews** with artisans to understand challenges in online selling.
3. Perform **field studies** to observe current selling and marketing practices.
4. Conduct **surveys** for buyers to understand expectations and trust issues.

UX Problem Statement 2:
*Busy professionals need a way to receive personalized workout reminders because they often forget or skip sessions, which results in poor health progress.*



2. Research Methods & Justification

* **Surveys:** To gather quantitative data on user habits, workout frequency, and preferred features.
* **Interviews:** To understand emotional triggers, motivations, and barriers to maintaining routines.
* **Usability Testing:** To observe how users navigate the prototype and identify confusion points.

**Justification:**
Surveys provide broad insights into user behavior, while interviews and usability tests help uncover deeper emotional and usability challenges.
